# Support

The goal with this kind of support is to cover our yearly expenses such as website and domain name.
So far we've used some of the earned coffee money to buy a Raspberry Pi 5 to be able to test more of the potential setups that you use out there.

## Buy me a coffee

Press the link to buy us some coffee. We love coffee but we'll probably spend it on something else. :)
